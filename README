1. obtain tadpole lure (it blinks the led on Calamari Lure as well - https://elinux.org/Minnowboard:MaxLures#Calamari_Lure https://elinux.org/Minnowboard:MaxLures#Calamari_Lure)
2. assemble/solder as per http://minnowboard.outof.biz/Tadpole_Lure.html
3. use OE to create an image for the minnow (core-image-full-cmdline is good)
4. add tadpole_blink.sh to image and run
5. instead of adding it manually to the image you can use the tadpole.bb recipe here to install it automatically
   (copy tadpole.bb into your layer, add it to image with IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " tadpole")
